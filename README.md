# fdf_intra
Small projects that takes an input file where rows represent y coordinate, columns represent x coordinate and the values separated by whitespaces represent z coordinate. Example:
1 1 1 1 1
1 2 2 2 1
1 2 3 2 1
1 2 2 2 1
1 1 1 1 1
And then draws Isometric/Parallel projection based on that file.

How to build and use:
make
./fdf file_name
